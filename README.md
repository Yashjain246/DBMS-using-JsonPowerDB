# DBMS using JsonPowerDB 🚀

## 📄 Description
This project demonstrates a **Student Enrollment Form** built using **HTML, JavaScript**, and connected to a cloud-based NoSQL database — **JsonPowerDB (JPDB)**. It allows seamless form data submission, validation, and secure storage without the complexity of a traditional SQL-based backend.

The form captures basic student details such as **Name, Roll No, Class**, and stores them directly into JPDB using REST APIs.
